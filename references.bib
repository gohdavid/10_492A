	abstract = {The quantification of protein biomarkers in blood at picomolar-level sensitivity requires labour-intensive incubation and washing steps. Sensing proteins in sweat, which would allow for point-of-care monitoring, is hindered by the typically large interpersonal and intrapersonal variations in its composition. Here we report the design and performance of a wearable and wireless patch for the real-time electrochemical detection of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive (CRP) protein in sweat. The device integrates iontophoretic sweat extraction, microfluidic channels for sweat sampling and for reagent routing and replacement, and a graphene-based sensor array for quantifying CRP (via an electrode functionalized with anti-CRP capture antibodies-conjugated gold nanoparticles), ionic strength, pH and temperature for the real-time calibration of the CRP sensor. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with active or past infections or who had heart failure, the elevated concentrations of CRP measured via the patch correlated well with the protein’s levels in serum. Wearable biosensors for the real-time sensitive analysis of inflammatory proteins in sweat may facilitate the management of chronic diseases.},

	abstract = {C-reactive protein (CRP) was discovered by Tillett and Francis in 1930. The name CRP arose because it was first identified as a substance in the serum of patients with acute inflammation that reacted with the "c" carbohydrate antigen of the capsule of pneumococcus. CRP is a pentameric protein synthesized by the liver, whose level rises in response to inflammation. CRP is an acute-phase reactant protein that is primarily induced by the IL-6 action on the gene responsible for the transcription of CRP during the acute phase of an inflammatory/infectious process. There is some question about whether dysregulation of the role of CRP in the clearance of apoptotic cells and cellular debris plays a role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but this has not been definitively demonstrated. It has been demonstrated to have some protective properties in animal studies on lung tissue in alveolitis by reducing neutrophil-mediated damage to the alveoli and protein leakage into the lung. CRP has both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties. It plays a role in the recognition and clearance of foreign pathogens and damaged cells by binding to phosphocholine, phospholipids, histone, chromatin, and fibronectin. It can activate the classic complement pathway and also activate phagocytic cells via Fc receptors to expedite the removal of cellular debris and damaged or apoptotic cells and foreign pathogens. This can become pathologic, however, when it is activated by autoantibodies displaying the phosphocholine arm in auto-immune processes, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). It can also worsen tissue damage in certain cases by activation of the complement system and thus inflammatory cytokines. As compared to the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which is an indirect test for inflammation, the levels of CRP rise and fall rapidly with the onset and removal of the inflammatory stimulus, respectively. Persistently elevated CRP levels can be seen in chronic inflammatory conditions such as chronic infections or inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis. There are numerous causes of an elevated C-reactive protein.  These include acute and chronic conditions, and these can be infectious or non-infectious in etiology. However, markedly elevated levels of CRP are most often associated with an infectious cause (an example of pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition).  Trauma can also cause elevations in CRP (alarmin response). More modest elevations tend to be associated with a broader spectrum of etiologies, ranging from sleep disturbances to periodontal disease.},

It is known as a biomarker of acute inflammation, but many large-scale prospective studies demonstrate that CRP is also known to be associated with chronic inflammation. This review is focused on discussing the clinical significance of CRP in chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, age-related macular degeneration, hemorrhagic stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease, including recent advances on the implication of CRP and its forms specifically on the pathogenesis of these diseases.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than 1.2 million people in the United States are affected by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Inflammatory bowel disease has a natural course characterized by alternating periods of remission and relapse. Currently, disease flares are unpredictable as they occur in a random way. Further, current testing methods and practices lack the ability for real-time tracking of flares. There exists no technology that can be utilized for continuous monitoring of biomarkers, as most of these rely on samples such as blood, feces, and testing methods by which continuous monitoring is not feasible. Cytokines play a key role in IBD; the development, recurrence, and exacerbation of the inflammatory process are orchestrated by their levels in time and space. Cytokines are also present in sweat. We hypothesize that demonstrating real-time continuous monitoring of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and C-reactive protein (CRP) may help create an enabling technology to track inflammation in IBD patients and identify flare-ups and assess efficacy of therapy.
METHODS: A multiplexed SWEATSENSER was used for noninvasive continuous monitoring of interleukin-1β and C-reactive protein in human eccrine sweat. Impedance spectroscopy was used to measure the sensor response. Sweat was collected using an FDA-approved PharmChek patch from 26 healthy human subjects to determine the levels of the 2 study inflammatory markers. Correlation analysis was performed for preclinical validation of the SWEATSENSER with ELISA as the reference method. On-body continuous monitoring measurements were performed on 20 human subjects using EnLiSense's SWEATSENSER wearable device for real-time monitoring studies.
RESULTS: The sensor device can detect interleukin-1β and C-reactive protein in sweat over a dynamic range of 3 log orders. Pearson correlation of r = 0.99 and r = 0.95 was achieved for IL-1β and CRP, respectively, for the SWEATSENSER with ELISA. Bland-Altman results further confirmed a good agreement (mean bias of -0.25 and -3.9 pg/mL for IL-1β and CRP, respectively) of the device with the reference method, demonstrating applicability of the device for real-time monitoring. Continuous on-body measurements were performed in 20 healthy human subjects for the detection of IL-1β to establish the preclinical utility of the sensor device. The continuous on-body measurements in healthy cohort reported a mean IL-1β concentration of {\textasciitilde}28 pg/mL. Stable measurements for over continuous 30 hours was reported by the device.
CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates the first proof-of-feasibility of multiplexed cytokine and inflammatory marker detection in passively expressed eccrine sweat in a wearable form-factor that can be utilized toward better management of inflammatory bowel disease. This is a first step toward demonstrating a noninvasive enabling technology that can enable baseline tracking of an inflammatory response. Furthermore, this is the first study to report and quantify the presence of CRP in human eccrine sweat.},

A separate line of research has reported that fast eye movements known as saccades allow simple modulated LEDs to be observed at very high rates. Here we show that humans perceive visual flicker artifacts at rates over 500 Hz when a display includes high frequency spatial edges. This rate is many times higher than previously reported. As a result, modern display designs which use complex spatio-temporal coding need to update much faster than conventional TVs, which traditionally presented a simple sequence of natural images.},

Here, an analysis in this direction is conducted for two water-insoluble biocompatible polymers, poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) and cyclic(poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate)), and a non-biocompatible polymer, poly(n-butyl acrylate), by measuring their IR spectra under humidified conditions and by carrying out theoretical calculations on model complex systems. It is found that the OH stretching bands of water are decomposed into four components, and while the higher-frequency components (with peaks at ∼3610 and ∼3540 cm–1) behave in parallel with the C═O and C–O–C stretching and CH deformation bands of the polymers, the lower-frequency components (with peaks at ∼3430 and ∼3260 cm–1) become pronounced to a greater extent with increasing humidity. From the theoretical calculations, it is shown that the OH stretching frequency that is distributed from ∼3650 to ∼3200 cm–1 is correlated to the hydrogen-bond configurations and is mainly controlled by the electric field that is sensed by the vibrating H atom. By combining these observed and calculated results, the configurations of water at the interface of the polymers are discussed.},

In this Perspective, we summarize our recent studies that have revealed that the H–O–H bending mode can be an equally powerful reporter for the microscopic structure of water and provides more direct access to the hydrogen-bonded network than the conventionally studied O–H stretch mode. We discuss the fundamental vibrational properties of the water bending mode, such as the intermolecular vibrational coupling, and its effects on the spectral lineshapes and vibrational dynamics. Several examples of static and ultrafast bending mode spectroscopy illustrate how the water bending mode provides an excellent window on the microscopic structure of both bulk and interfacial water.},

Water-water potential depends upon inter-molecular distance, relative orientation of water molecules, and also local environment. When placed at a favorable distance in a favorable orientation, water molecules exhibit a particularly strong attractive interaction called hydrogen bond. Although hydrogen bond is very important for its effects on the elements of life, industrial applications, and bulk water properties, there is no scientific consensus on its true nature and origin. Using quantum-mechanical methods, hydrogen bond strength was calculated in different local environments. A simple empirical linear relationship was discovered between maximum hydrogen bond strength and the number of water molecules in the local environment. The local environment effect was shown to be considerable even on the second coordination shell. Additionally, a negative linear correlation was found between maximum hydrogen bond strength and the distance, at which it was observed. These results provide novel insights into the nature of hydrogen bonding.},

However, force fields also continue to limit the accuracy of predictions of physical properties. Current parameterization of these force fields involves a huge amount of human effort -- often years of work -- and depends heavily on the chemical intuition of those involved. The Open Force Field Initiative is working to replace this tedious process with an automated machinery to learn parameters and chemical perception. Our new SMIRKS-based force field format, SMIRNOFF, allows all parameter types to be defined independently. This allows for easier extension compared to the traditional atom type-based force fields where the chemical perception of all parameter types is intertwined. We will need to be capable of programmatically learning SMIRKS patterns in order to fully automate force field parameterization. In this work, we present ChemPer -- a new tool for generating SMIRKS patterns based on clustered fragments (i.e. bonds, angles, or torsions) which should be assigned the same force field parameter. We demonstrate the utility of ChemPer by clustering fragments based on a reference force field, and then regenerating those parameters starting with a simple set of alkanes, ethers, and alcohols. Next, we create SMIRKS patterns for a protein SMIRNOFF which match the parameters from AMBER99. We conclude with a discussion of other potential applications and expansions to ChemPer.},

	abstract = {Due to the large number of different surfactant and solute molecules used in micellar solutions, it is important to have predictive models for micelle-water partition equilibrium. The relative new method COSMOmic, an extension of COSMO-RS, can predict thermodynamic data by taking the anisotropy of a system into account. For this purpose, it needs the structure of the system in atomistic resolution. In previous studies, atomic distributions were obtained from self-assembly molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this work MD simulations starting from pre-assembled micelles are used to receive atomic distributions. These simulations are more efficient than self-assembly simulations with respect to system size and simulation time and allow the detailed study of micelle size/structure influences on solute partitioning. For the first time a wide range of aggregation numbers for different types of surfactants are investigated. More than 90 different micelles structures were obtained for six different surfactants: SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), CTAB (cetyltrimetylammonium bromide), C12E10, Brij35 (C12E23), Triton X-114 and Triton X-100 with initial aggregation numbers between 20 and 160. These were investigated with respect to micelle size, micelle shape, surfactant concentration and simulation time. To examine the prediction quality of COSMOmic, experimental data was collected and 36 micelle-water partition coefficients for C12E10, Triton X-100 and Brij35 were measured. In total more than 370 experimental partition coefficients were used to validate the calculations. The results show that the calculations are in good agreement with the experimental data and that they are better than predictions from methods that do not take the micelle structure into account (pseudo phase approach). In this context, small spherical micelles are proven to be more efficient while larger more ellipsoidal micelles show a higher probability to result in outliers. Therefore, this article provides a guideline for the development of averaged atomic distributions as input for COSMOmic.},

However, a limitation for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is that they must be performed on finite-sized systems in order to map onto computational resources. To minimize artifacts arising from finite-sized simulation systems, it is common practice for MD simulations to be performed with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). However, in order to calculate specific physical properties, such as mean square displacements to calculate diffusion coefficients, continuous particle trajectories where the atomic movements are continuous and do not jump between cell faces are required. In these cases, modifying atomic coordinates through unwrapping schemes is an essential post-processing tool to remove these jumps. Here, two established trajectory unwrapping schemes are applied to 1 μs wrapped trajectories for a small water box and lysozyme in water. The existing schemes can result in spurious diffusion coefficients, long bonds within unwrapped molecules, and inconsistent atomic coordinates when coordinates are rewrapped after unwrapping. We determine that prior unwrapping schemes do not account for changing periodic box dimensions and introduce an additional correction term to the existing displacement unwrapping scheme to correct for these artifacts. We also demonstrate that the resulting algorithm is a hybrid between the existing heuristic and displacement unwrapping schemes. After treatment using this new unwrapping scheme, molecular geometries are correct even after long simulations. In anticipation for longer MD trajectories, we develop implementations for this new scheme in multiple PBC handling tools.},

	abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quickhull algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of “thick” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

	abstract = {Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input files are simple and currently compatible with PDB, Tinker, Molden, or Moldy coordinate files.

It is implemented as a force field but makes extensive use of facilities unique to the GROMACS software, including virtual sites and bonded terms that are not commonly used in standard atomistic force fields. OpenMM is a flexible molecular dynamics package widely used for methods development and is competitive in speed on GPUs with other commonly used packages. OpenMM has facilities to easily implement new force field terms, external forces and fields, and other nonstandard features, which we use to implement all force field terms used in Martini 2 and Martini 3. This allows Martini simulations, starting with GROMACS topology files that are processed by custom scripts, with all the added flexibility of OpenMM. We provide a GitHub repository with test cases, compare accuracy and performance between GROMACS and OpenMM, and discuss the limitations of our implementation in terms of direct comparison with GROMACS. We describe a use case that implements the Modeling Employing Limited Data method to apply experimental constraints in a Martini simulation to efficiently determine the structure of a protein complex.

We benchmark quality and performance of the approach by creating realistic coordinates for polymer melt simulations, single-stranded as well as circular single-stranded DNA. We further demonstrate the power of our approach by setting up a microphase-separated block copolymer system, and by generating a liquid-liquid phase separated system inside a lipid vesicle.},

We demonstrate that our model behaves well in five different areas of application: (1) it produces accurate densities and phase behavior or small PEO oligomers and water mixtures; (2) it yields chain dimensions in good agreement with the experiment in three different solvents (water, diglyme, and benzene) over a broad range of molecular weights (∼1.2 kg/mol to 21 kg/mol); (3) it reproduces qualitatively the structural features of lipid bilayers containing PEGylated lipids in the brush and mushroom regime; (4) it is able to reproduce the phase behavior of several PEO-based nonionic surfactants in water; and (5) it can be combined with the existing MARTINI PS to model PS-PEO block copolymers.

Application of the new model to lipid bilayers shows an improved behavior in terms of the stress profile across the bilayer and the tendency to form pores. An extension of the force field now also allows the simulation of planar (ring) compounds, including sterols.

	abstract = {This paper describes the parametrization of a new coarse grained (CG) model for lipid and surfactant systems. Reduction of the number of degrees of freedom together with the use of short range potentials makes it computationally very efficient. Compared to atomistic models a gain of 3−4 orders of magnitude can be achieved. Micrometer length scales or millisecond time scales are therefore within reach. To encourage applications, the model is kept very simple. Only a small number of coarse grained atom types are defined, which interact using a few discrete levels of interaction. Despite the computational speed and the simplistic nature of the model, it proves to be both versatile in its applications and accurate in its predictions. We show that densities of liquid alkanes from decane up to eicosane can be reproduced to within 5\%, and the mutual solubilities of alkanes in water and water in alkanes can be reproduced within 0.5 kT of the experimental values. The CG model for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is shown to aggregate spontaneously into a bilayer. Structural properties such as the area per headgroup and the phosphate−phosphate distance match the experimentally measured quantities closely. The same is true for elastic properties such as the bending modulus and the area compressibility, and dynamic properties such as the lipid lateral diffusion coefficient and the water permeation rate. The distribution of the individual lipid components along the bilayer normal is very similar to distributions obtained from atomistic simulations. Phospholipids with different headgroup (ethanolamine) or different tail lengths (lauroyl, stearoyl) or unsaturated tails (oleoyl) can also be modeled with the CG force field. The experimental area per headgroup can be reproduced for most lipids within 0.02 nm2. Finally, the CG model is applied to nonbilayer phases. Dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) aggregates into small micelles that are structurally very similar to ones modeled atomistically, and DOPE forms an inverted hexagonal phase with structural parameters in agreement with experimental data.},

	abstract = {We introduce the Open Force Field (OpenFF) 2.0.0 small molecule force field for drug-like molecules, code-named Sage, which builds upon our previous iteration, Parsley. OpenFF force fields are based on direct chemical perception, which generalizes easily to highly diverse sets of chemistries based on substructure queries. Like the previous OpenFF iterations, the Sage generation of OpenFF force fields was validated in protein-ligand simulations to be compatible with AMBER biopolymer force fields. In this work, we detail the methodology used to develop this force field, as well as the innovations and improvements introduced since the release of Parsley 1.0.0. One particularly significant feature of Sage is a set of improved Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters retrained against condensed phase mixture data, the first refit of LJ parameters in the OpenFF small molecule force field line. Sage also includes valence parameters refit to a larger database of quantum chemical calculations than previous versions, as well as improvements in how this fitting is performed. Force field benchmarks show improvements in general metrics of performance against quantum chemistry reference data such as root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of optimized conformer geometries, torsion fingerprint deviations (TFD), and improved relative conformer energetics (ΔΔE). We present a variety of benchmarks for these metrics against our previous force fields as well as in some cases other small molecule force fields. Sage also demonstrates improved performance in estimating physical properties, including comparison against experimental data from various thermodynamic databases for small molecule properties such as ΔHmix, ρ(x), ΔGsolv, and ΔGtrans. Additionally, we benchmarked against protein-ligand binding free energies (ΔGbind), where Sage yields results statistically similar to previous force fields. All the data is made publicly available along with complete details on how to reproduce the training results at https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-sage.},

The triblock polymer included a short poly(1,2-butylene oxide) (PBO) at the hydrophilic-hydrophobic interface of these systems. Keeping the hydrophilic length fixed (MePEG45), we considered 250 chains in which the hydrophobic length changed from PCL44 or PBO6-b-PCL43 to PCL62 or PBO9-b-PCL61. The polymers were solvated in explicit water for 2 μs of simulations at 310.15 K. We found that the longer diblock system undergoes a morphological transition from an intermediate rod-like micelle to a prolate-sphere, while the micelle formed from the longer triblock system is a stable rod-like micelle. The two shorter diblock and triblock systems show similar self-assembly processes, both resulting in slightly prolate-spheres. The dynamics of the self-assembly is quantified in terms of chain radius of gyration, shape anisotropy, and hydration of the micelle cores. The final micelle structures are analyzed in terms of the local density components. We conclude that the CG model accurately describes the molecular mechanisms of self-assembly and the equilibrium micellar structures of hydrophilic and hydrophobic chains, including the quantity of solvent trapped inside the micellar core.},

Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems.},

Structural and functional characterization of the many constituents of the red cell membrane, in conjunction with biophysical and physiologic studies, has led to detailed description of the way in which the remarkable mechanical properties and other important characteristics of the red cells arise, and of the manner in which they fail in disease states.

	abstract = {We present the first global parameterization and validation of a novel charge model, called AM1-BCC, which quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of {\textgreater}2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.(13) Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules.},

	abstract = {We introduce the Open Force Field (OpenFF) 2.0.0 small molecule force field for drug-like molecules, code-named Sage, which builds upon our previous iteration, Parsley. OpenFF force fields are based on direct chemical perception, which generalizes easily to highly diverse sets of chemistries based on substructure queries. Like the previous OpenFF iterations, the Sage generation of OpenFF force fields was validated in protein–ligand simulations to be compatible with AMBER biopolymer force fields. In this work, we detail the methodology used to develop this force field, as well as the innovations and improvements introduced since the release of Parsley 1.0.0. One particularly significant feature of Sage is a set of improved Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters retrained against condensed phase mixture data, the first refit of LJ parameters in the OpenFF small molecule force field line. Sage also includes valence parameters refit to a larger database of quantum chemical calculations than previous versions, as well as improvements in how this fitting is performed. Force field benchmarks show improvements in general metrics of performance against quantum chemistry reference data such as root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of optimized conformer geometries, torsion fingerprint deviations (TFD), and improved relative conformer energetics (ΔΔE). We present a variety of benchmarks for these metrics against our previous force fields as well as in some cases other small molecule force fields. Sage also demonstrates improved performance in estimating physical properties, including comparison against experimental data from various thermodynamic databases for small molecule properties such as ΔHmix, ρ(x), ΔGsolv, and ΔGtrans. Additionally, we benchmarked against protein–ligand binding free energies (ΔGbind), where Sage yields results statistically similar to previous force fields. All the data is made publicly available along with complete details on how to reproduce the training results at https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-sage.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2022.01.20.477041},
	abstract = {Abstract
          
            With rising bacterial resistance, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been widely investigated as potential antibacterial molecules to replace conventional antibiotics. Our understanding of the molecular mechanism for membrane disruption are largely based on AMP interactions with the inner phospholipid bilayers of both Gram-negative and Grampositive bacteria. Mechanisms for AMP translocation across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria composed of lipopolysaccharides and the asymmetric lipid bilayer are incompletely understood. In the current study, we have employed atomistic molecular dynamics and umbrella sampling simulations with an aggregate duration of
            {\textasciitilde}
            8 microseconds to understand the free energy landscape of CM15 peptide within the OM of Gram-negative bacteria,
            E. coli
            . The peptide has a favourable binding free energy (−130 kJ mol
            −1
            ) in the O-antigen region with a large barrier (150 kJ mol
            −1
            ) at the interface between the anionic coresaccharides and upper bilayer leaflet made up of lipid A molecules. We have analyzed the peptide and membrane properties at each of the 100 ns duration umbrella sampling windows to study variations in the membrane and the peptide structure during the translocation through the OM. Interestingly the peptide is seen to elongate, adopting a membrane perpendicular orientation in the phospholipid region resulting in the formation of a transient water channel during it’s translocation through the bilayer. The presence of the peptide at the lipid A and core-saccharide interface results in a 11\% increase in the membrane area with the peptide adopting a predominantly membrane parallel orientation in this cation rich region. Additionally, the lateral displacement of the peptide is significantly reduced in this region, and increases toward the inner phospholipid leaflet and the outer O-antigen regions of the membrane. The peptide is found to be sufficiently hydrated across both the hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic regions of the membrane and remains unstructured without any gain in helical content. Our study unravels the complex free energy landscape for the translocation of the AMP CM15 across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and we discuss the implications of our findings with the broader question of how AMPs overcome this barrier during antimicrobial activity.},

	abstract = {The time step of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is determined by the fastest motions in the system and is typically limited to 2 fs. An increasingly popular approach is to increase the mass of the hydrogen atoms to ∼3 amu and decrease the mass of the parent atom by an equivalent amount. This approach, known as hydrogen-mass repartitioning (HMR), permits time steps up to 4 fs with reasonable simulation stability. While HMR has been applied in many published studies to date, it has not been extensively tested for membrane-containing systems. Here, we compare the results of simulations of a variety of membranes and membrane–protein systems run using a 2 fs time step and a 4 fs time step with HMR. For pure membrane systems, we find almost no difference in structural properties, such as area-per-lipid, electron density profiles, and order parameters, although there are differences in kinetic properties such as the diffusion constant. Conductance through a porin in an applied field, partitioning of a small peptide, hydrogen-bond dynamics, and membrane mixing show very little dependence on HMR and the time step. We also tested a 9 Å cutoff as compared to the standard CHARMM cutoff of 12 Å, finding significant deviations in many properties tested. We conclude that HMR is a valid approach for membrane systems, but a 9 Å cutoff is not.},

LB has a high potential as an alternative to fossil resources to produce second-generation biofuels and biosourced chemicals and materials without compromising global food security. One of the major limitations to LB valorisation is its recalcitrance to enzymatic hydrolysis caused by the heterogeneous multi-scale structure of plant cell walls. Factors affecting LB recalcitrance are strongly interconnected and difficult to dissociate. They can be divided into structural factors (cellulose specific surface area, cellulose crystallinity, degree of polymerization, pore size and volume) and chemical factors (composition and content in lignin, hemicelluloses, acetyl groups). Goal of this review is to propose an up-to-date survey of the relative impact of chemical and structural factors on biomass recalcitrance and of the most advanced techniques to evaluate these factors. Also, recent spectral and water-related measurements accurately predicting hydrolysis are presented. Overall, combination of relevant factors and specific measurements gathering simultaneously structural and chemical information should help to develop robust and efficient LB conversion processes into bioproducts.},

Taking into account the latest developments in the field, this fully revised and updated second edition: * features a new chapter devoted to the use of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs); * presents current results on fundamental performance limitations introduced by RHP-poles and RHP-zeros; * introduces updated material on the selection of controlled variables and self-optimizing control; * provides simple IMC tuning rules for PID control; * covers additional material including unstable plants, the feedback amplifier, the lower gain margin and a clear strategy for incorporating integral action into LQG control; * includes numerous worked examples, exercises and case studies, which make frequent use of Matlab and the new Robust Control toolbox.  Multivariable Feedback Control: Analysis and Design, Second Edition is an excellent resource for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses studying multivariable control. It is also an invaluable tool for engineers who want to understand multivariable control, its limitations, and how it can be applied in practice. The analysis techniques and the material on control structure design should prove very useful in the new emerging area of systems biology.  Reviews of the first edition:  "Being rich in insights and practical tips on controller design, the book should also prove to be very beneficial to industrial control engineers, both as a reference book and as an educational tool."

	abstract = {Recently, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to generate molecules with desired properties has been highlighted as a promising strategy for drug design. A molecular docking program - a physical simulation that estimates protein-small molecule binding affinity - can be an ideal reward scoring function for RL, as it is a straightforward proxy of the therapeutic potential. Still, two imminent challenges exist for this task. First, the models often fail to generate chemically realistic and pharmacochemically acceptable molecules. Second, the docking score optimization is a difficult exploration problem that involves many local optima and less smooth surfaces with respect to molecular structure. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework that generates pharmacochemically acceptable molecules with large docking scores. Our method - Fragment-based generative RL with Explorative Experience replay for Drug design (FREED) - constrains the generated molecules to a realistic and qualified chemical space and effectively explores the space to find drugs by coupling our fragment-based generation method and a novel error-prioritized experience replay (PER). We also show that our model performs well on both de novo and scaffold-based schemes. Our model produces molecules of higher quality compared to existing methods while achieving state-of-the-art performance on two of three targets in terms of the docking scores of the generated molecules. We further show with ablation studies that our method, predictive error-PER (FREED(PE)), significantly improves the model performance.},

	abstract = {Synaptic vesicles are primed into a state that is ready for fast neurotransmitter release upon Ca2+-binding to Synaptotagmin-1. This state likely includes trans-SNARE complexes between the vesicle and plasma membranes that are bound to Synaptotagmin-1 and complexins. However, the nature of this state and the steps leading to membrane fusion are unclear, in part because of the difficulty of studying this dynamic process experimentally. To shed light into these questions, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of systems containing trans-SNARE complexes between two flat bilayers or a vesicle and a flat bilayer with or without fragments of Synaptotagmin-1 and/or complexin-1. Our results need to be interpreted with caution because of the limited simulation times and the absence of key components, but suggest mechanistic features that may control release and help visualize potential states of the primed Synaptotagmin-1-SNARE-complexin-1 complex. The simulations suggest that SNAREs alone induce formation of extended membrane-membrane contact interfaces that may fuse slowly, and that the primed state contains macromolecular assemblies of trans-SNARE complexes bound to the Synaptotagmin-1 C2B domain and complexin-1 in a spring-loaded configuration that prevents premature membrane merger and formation of extended interfaces, but keeps the system ready for fast fusion upon Ca2+ influx.},

However, for molecules outside the training set, the parameters are potentially inaccurate and it may be preferable to derive molecule-speciﬁc parameters. Here we present an intuitive parameter derivation toolkit, QUBEKit (QUantum mechanical BEspoke Kit), which enables the automated generation of system-speciﬁc small molecule force ﬁeld parameters directly from quantum mechanics. QUBEKit is written in python and combines bond, angle, torsion, charge, and Lennard-Jones parameter derivation methodologies alongside a method for deriving the positions and charges of oﬀ-center virtual sites from the partitioned quantum mechanical electron density. As a proof of concept, we have rederived a complete set of parameters for 109 small organic molecules and assessed the accuracy by comparing computed liquid properties with experiments. QUBEKit gives competitive results when compared to standard transferable force ﬁelds, with mean unsigned errors of 0.024 g/cm3, 0.79 kcal/mol, and 1.17 kcal/mol for the liquid density, heat of vaporization, and free energy of hydration, respectively. This indicates that the derived parameters are suitable for molecular modeling applications, including computer-aided drug design.},

Existing kinetic cell culture models can effectively describe the underlying mechanisms but require considerable development and parameterisation effort. Stoichiometric models, on the other hand, provide a generic, parameter-free means for describing metabolic behaviour but do not extend to product quality prediction. We have overcome this limitation by integrating a stoichiometric model of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell metabolism with an artificial neural network that uses the fluxes of nucleotide sugar donor synthesis to compute the profile of Fc N-glycosylation, a critical quality attribute of antibody therapeutics. We demonstrate that this hybrid framework accurately computes glycan distribution profiles using a set of easy-to-obtain experimental data, thus providing a platform for process control applications.},

A key enabler of rapid response is having quality-oriented disease-agnostic manufacturing protocols ready ahead of outbreaks. We are the first to apply the Quality by Design (QbD) framework to enhance rapid-response RNA vaccine manufacturing against known and future viral pathogens. This QbD framework aims to support the development and consistent production of safe and efficacious RNA vaccines, integrating a novel qualitative methodology and a quantitative bioprocess model. The qualitative methodology identifies and assesses the direction, magnitude and shape of the impact of critical process parameters (CPPs) on critical quality attributes (CQAs). The mechanistic bioprocess model quantifies and maps the effect of four CPPs on the CQA of effective yield of RNA drug substance. Consequently, the first design space of an RNA vaccine synthesis bioreactor is obtained. The cost-yield optimization together with the probabilistic design space contribute towards automation of rapid-response, high-quality RNA vaccine production.},

We show that RNA signals through human TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8, but incorporation of modified nucleosides m5C, m6A, m5U, s2U, or pseudouridine ablates activity. Dendritic cells (DCs) exposed to such modified RNA express significantly less cytokines and activation markers than those treated with unmodified RNA. DCs and TLR-expressing cells are potently activated by bacterial and mitochondrial RNA, but not by mammalian total RNA, which is abundant in modified nucleosides. We conclude that nucleoside modifications suppress the potential of RNA to activate DCs. The innate immune system may therefore detect RNA lacking nucleoside modification as a means of selectively responding to bacteria or necrotic tissue.},

We found that mRNAs containing pseudouridines have a higher translational capacity than unmodified mRNAs when tested in mammalian cells and lysates or administered intravenously into mice at 0.015-0.15 mg/kg doses. The delivered mRNA and the encoded protein could be detected in the spleen at 1, 4, and 24 hours after the injection, where both products were at significantly higher levels when pseudouridine-containing mRNA was administered. Even at higher doses, only the unmodified mRNA was immunogenic, inducing high serum levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). These findings indicate that nucleoside modification is an effective approach to enhance stability and translational capacity of mRNA while diminishing its immunogenicity in vivo. Improved properties conferred by pseudouridine make such mRNA a promising tool for both gene replacement and vaccination.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2206.07824},
	abstract = {A common theme in causal inference is learning causal relationships between observed variables, also known as causal discovery. This is usually a daunting task, given the large number of candidate causal graphs and the combinatorial nature of the search space. Perhaps for this reason, most research has so far focused on relatively small causal graphs, with up to hundreds of nodes. However, recent advances in fields like biology enable generating experimental data sets with thousands of interventions followed by rich profiling of thousands of variables, raising the opportunity and urgent need for large causal graph models. Here, we introduce the notion of factor directed acyclic graphs (f-DAGs) as a way to restrict the search space to non-linear low-rank causal interaction models. Combining this novel structural assumption with recent advances that bridge the gap between causal discovery and continuous optimization, we achieve causal discovery on thousands of variables. Additionally, as a model for the impact of statistical noise on this estimation procedure, we study a model of edge perturbations of the f-DAG skeleton based on random graphs and quantify the effect of such perturbations on the f-DAG rank. This theoretical analysis suggests that the set of candidate f-DAGs is much smaller than the whole DAG space and thus more statistically robust in the high-dimensional regime where the underlying skeleton is hard to assess. We propose Differentiable Causal Discovery of Factor Graphs (DCD-FG), a scalable implementation of f-DAG constrained causal discovery for high-dimensional interventional data. DCD-FG uses a Gaussian non-linear low-rank structural equation model and shows significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods in both simulations as well as a recent large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing data set with hundreds of genetic interventions.},

A 2nd purpose was to replicate the findings from previous research that notes and verbal working memory were significantly related to test performance. Results indicated that transcription fluency was the only predictor of quality of notes and that quality of notes was the only significant predictor of test performance.

This toolkit is built in Julia, a modern language for scientific computing known for its ease of use, extensibility, and first-class support for differentiable programming. We currently support more models than any package available, including standard cubic (SRK, PR, PSRK, etc.), activity-coefficient (NRTL, UNIFAC, etc.), COSMO-based, and the venerable SAFT equations. The property-estimation methods supported are extensive, including bulk, VLE, LLE, VLLE and critical properties.

Trehalose accumulated in freezing-and desiccation-tolerant organisms in nature has been sought as an attractive nontoxic cryoprotectant. Herein, we report a coincubation method for very rapid and efficient delivery of membrane-impermeable trehalose into ovine erythrocytes through reversible membrane permeabilization using pH-responsive, comb-like pseudopeptides. The pseudopeptidic polymers containing relatively long alkyl side chains were synthesized to mimic membrane-anchoring fusogenic proteins. The intracellular trehalose delivery efficiency was optimized by manipulating the side chain length, degree of substitution, and concentration of the pseudopeptides with different hydrophobic alkyl side chains, the pH, temperature, and time of incubation, as well as the polymer-to-cell ratio and the concentration of extracellular trehalose. Treatment of erythrocytes with the comb-like pseudopeptides for only 15 min yielded an intracellular trehalose concentration of 177.9 ± 8.6 mM, which resulted in 90.3 ± 0.7\% survival after freeze-thaw. The very rapid and efficient delivery was found to be attributed to the reversible, pronounced membrane curvature change as a result of strong membrane insertion of the comb-like pseudopeptides. The pseudopeptides can enable efficient intracellular delivery of not only trehalose for improved cell cryopreservation but also other membrane-impermeable cargos.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The glycocalyx is a shell of heavily glycosylated proteins and lipids distributed on the cell surface of nearly all cell types. Recently, it has been found that bulky transmembrane glycoproteins such as MUC1 can modulate membrane shape by inducing membrane protrusions. In this work, we examine the reciprocal relationship of how membrane shape affects MUC1’s spatial distribution on the cell membrane and its biological significance. By employing nanopatterned surfaces and membrane-sculpting proteins to manipulate membrane curvature, we show that MUC1 avoids positively-curved membranes (membrane invaginations) and accumulates on negatively-curved membranes (membrane protrusions). MUC1’s curvature sensitivity is dependent on the length and the extent of glycosylation of its ectodomain, with large and highly glycosylated forms preferentially staying out of positive curvature. Interestingly, MUC1’s avoidance of positive membrane curvature enables it to escape from endocytosis and being removed from the cell membrane. These findings also suggest that the truncation of MUC1’s ectodomain, often observed in breast and ovarian cancers, may enhance its endocytosis and potentiate its intracellular accumulation and signaling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Two technologies were developed; the first based on the separate expression of precursors of chains A and B of insulin, and the second based on the expression of a precursor of proinsulin as a Trp-E fusion protein. Both technologies utilized Escherichia coli as an expression system. Later, a third technology was developed based on a strain of yeast that can secrete a precursor of insulin. The second E. coli process, a variation of which has been commercialized by Eli Lilly and Co., is analyzed in this article from a process design and economic evaluation viewpoint. The objective of this work is to elucidate the technical complexity and high cost associated with the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals. Human insulin is a good example of a protein-based biopharmaceutical produced in large quantities (a few tons per year) that requires large scale equipment and presents a multitude of scale-up challenges. Based on the analysis, a number of conclusions are drawn regarding the cost breakdown and cost dependency on process parameters. Recommendations are made for cost reduction and environmental impact minimization. This analysis was performed using a software tool for computer-aided biopro-cess design.},

However, the onset and progression remains poorly understood on a cellular and molecular level. Here we present a computational approach reanalysing a single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset (n=110k cells) from basic alignment to metabolic usage analysis to uncover the cellular and transcriptional changes in diagnosis, disease and remission stages of pediatric BALL. Using this approach we annotated and analysed 26 distinct clusters and 250 rare subclusters defining the BALL micro-environment contrasting the changes between initial diagnosis, effect of remission and in potential cases of relapse. We hypothesise and give context to B cell expression differences in BALL disease, remission and relapse stages in gene program utilisation and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Our analysis of BALL markers and metabolic expression demonstrate the increased significance of Pro-B cells in regulating the micro-environmental reactions in conjunction with Myeloid changes. We also identify increased HIF signalling and folate metabolism pathway highlighting the importance of a combined metabolic modelling approach to analysis. Given the breadth of data combined with the scope of a hypothesis-free approach to analysis of clusters, our study gives an initial all-embracing view into the BALL landscape.},

	abstract = {The improvement of heat recovery in the industry has traditionally been approached from two different viewpoints – Process Intensification and Process Integration. Many of the developments took the form of Heat Transfer Enhancement or Heat Integration within Heat Exchanger Networks, developing in parallel. In the past decade, however, there have been successful applications of both approaches together, resulting in cost benefits for heat-integrated retrofits. Heat Integration literature has continued to provide a variety of network modelling and retrofit approaches. Recent reviews of the area show that the mathematical-based and thermodynamic-based approaches have reached maturity within the current modelling paradigm. There are indications that the modelling concepts and frameworks need a further step-change to bridge the gap between the solutions to heat recovery problems offered by the current methods and the practical implementation in terms of real retrofit actions, leading to economically feasible reduction of energy use and emissions. The current paper takes these indications as a departure point and reviews the history and the recent developments in the areas of Heat Transfer Enhancement and the retrofit of Heat Exchanger Networks, providing a critical analysis from the viewpoint of obtaining practical solutions with positive cash flows, while minimising the issues related to operability – emissions, flexible operation and control. The analysis clearly shows the need to focus future research and development efforts on increasing model fidelity and practicality, addressing operability issues, and most importantly – development of flexible and efficient tools for communicating optimisation results to industrial practitioners and plant managers who would implement the process retrofit recommendations.},

	abstract = {b S Supporting Information I n organic chemical education, emphasis over the last few decades has shifted from content-centered, rote-memorization approaches toward conceptual approaches. Although concept-centered approaches present obvious advantages for students, overly abstract course material may cause students to disengage unless they gain an appreciation for the generality and applicability of concepts. At this university, the organic chemistry curriculum for nonmajors is rooted in a physical organic conceptual framework, relying, for instance, on a generalized classification of elementary mechanistic steps in terms of the frontier orbital interactions involved. 1 Keeping in mind the danger of "over-abstraction", we initiated course reforms to help students appreciate the generality of the concepts by applying them to biochemical topics aligned with their long-term interests. Both nonmajor organic chemistry courses involve a significant online component, which presents both advantages and challenges. 2 The traditional lecture has been replaced by three interactive online discussion sessions per week, at which time students solve problems individually using Web-based chemistry software. A consequence of our online mode of delivery is that studentÀ-student interactions have been limited. It has been recognized for nearly three decades that increased studentÀstudent interaction can improve student motivation and encourage critical thinking. 3 Thus, improving the social environment of our courses by fostering studentÀstudent interaction through collaborative learning became a second goal of our course reforms. Introducing collaboration in the context of Web-based chemistry software seemed a natural extension of our approach. Educators from diverse fields have recognized the benefits of collaborative learning for many years. 4 The interdependence encouraged by learning situations in which students must collaborate with one another to solve problems mirrors well the interdependence of professional scientific specialists tackling complex problems. Theories of collaborative learning have been adapted to online projects, 5 and a number of examples from this Journal have illustrated the advantages of collaborative chemistry projects. 6À9 Many of these projects took advantage of electronic resources and software available at their times of publication. We identified recent Web 2.0 technologies (such as wikis) and open source chemistry software (vide infra) as relatively untapped resources for collaborative chemistry projects. Wikis, collaborative Web pages that can be edited by a large number of users, are becoming common in educational settings as a framework for publishing the work of student teams. 10 In the physical sciences, wikis have been used for problem-based learning assignments, 11 collaborative technology simulations, 12 and other activities. 13À15 Using a common wiki page, students are able to collaborate with one another over large distances and at any time. By examining wiki page histories, instructors can trace the development of a page from start to finish and gauge the contributions of individual team members. Commenting tools facilitate collaboration between groups and offer a means for formative assessment of projects throughout the semester. Thus, wikis solve many of the problems that plague traditional group projects. 16 Additionally, the potential for wiki pages to reach a broad audience can enhance the quality of student work and provide motivation beyond simply getting the grade. 17 Wiki ABSTRACT: In recent years, postsecondary instructors have recognized the potential of wikis to transform the way students learn in a collaborative environment. However, few instructors have embraced in-depth student use of chemistry software for the creation of interactive chemistry content on the Web. Using currently available software, students are able to design, build, and describe computational molecular models with a high degree of independence. For a second-semester organic chemistry course with biochemistry applications , we designed and implemented a wiki-based project that involved student development of Web pages presenting the mechanism of action of a molecule of their choice. Student feedback supports the value of the project as a means to help students apply course content to biochemical applications. Organic chemistry instructors may benefit from the experience we gained while designing and implementing an organic chemistry wiki project.},

Findings revealed that most students explicitly stated that they felt positive about their ability to apply Wiki and peer feedback to writing instruction. Meaningful social interaction appears to play a significant role with regard to students' perceived benefits of this collaborative writing process.

The aim of the Wiki was to facilitate inter-professional learning for students who, having met face-to-face once for a classroom based activity, would not be timetabled to meet again. It was designed to allow students from differing disciplines to: construct knowledge together, learn from and about one another, and collaboratively produce a textual learning resource.150 nursing and radiography undergraduates were provided with a PBL trigger related to the acute presentation of stroke. The students met once (5 mixed-discipline groups) to discuss the role of the professions and the outcomes for the trigger scenario. Further learning was enabled through the provision of a Wiki for each group. At week 4, all Wikis were made visible for group peer assessment. Wiki editing skills were provided by student 'Wiki champions', who cascaded training to their peers. We report and reflect on the students' evaluations of both the Wiki as process and outcome and discuss the value of Wikis for inter-professional learning. Findings show that, in addition to being an enjoyable and flexible learning experience, the Wiki satisfied its intended aims.
